**Welcome to CS207!**

It is accpeted that computation has emerged as the third pillar of science alongside the 
pillars of theory and experiment.  Computational science is maturing rapidly and has found 
considerable and significant use in supporting scientists from various disciplines (including all 
engineering disciplines, physics, chemistry, finance, biology, and data analysis to name 
a few).  Many burgeoning scientists are still taught to write "a code" for some problem 
and to debug when things look wrong.  Given the ever-increasing complexity of software 
solutions to scientific problems, this old paradigm is no longer tenable.

CS207 is an applications course highlighting the use of software engineering and computer 
science in solving scientific problems. You will learn the fundamentals of developing 
scientific software systems including abstract thinking, the handling of data, and 
assessment of computational approaches: all in the context of good software engineering 
practices.

<!--
You should take this class if you want to be a good programmer or programming-capable member 
of your "company"'s data science team.

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

* Use Python, including its advanced features to write scientific programs

* understand what features of Python (or for that matter any programming language) make up its language execution model and how these features impact the code you write: e.g. how modularity, abstraction, and encapsulation can be used to solve problems

* write these programs with good software engineering practices

* code data management techniques to store data, staring from a good understanding of data structures.

* combine these techniques together to write large pieces of software (you will do a group project for this), working in a team of scientists, programmers, etc.

* Be able to hit the road running as a scientist in a startup or other company, or for that matter in academia: you will be able to evaluate and test software to see which one your group ought to use. You will also be a capable unicorn: able to contribute on both the science and software engineering sides of things.
